In this assignment you will implement a simple instruction set for a toy accumulator architecture. An
accumulator architecture is a class of computer architecture in which most or all instructions work on an
accumulator register. This is in contrast with a register architecture, which has many registers that may be
selected and used for computation and control.
Accumulator architectures were very common in the early computers from the 1940s through the 1960s,
but as the science of computing matured, we came to understand that register architectures were superior in
many ways, so accumulator architectures disappeared from the computing landscape.
But that accumulator architectures no longer exist in practice does not imply that they are not interesting
machines! There is much to be learned by both neophyte and experienced computer scientists about the
practice of computing by looking at the design of an accumulator architecture, and by programming one.
Our architecture, called CS227COMP, is digital (base 10, as opposed to binary, base 2) and has only 13
instructions, and yet that is sufficient to solve non-trivial problems; in fact, it’s theoretically as “powerful”
as any modern computer!
